Here's the instruction: In a large enough pan, add the butter and the olive oil, the sage leaves and the garlics with the skin on them. When the butter starts to sizzle add the chicken thighs skin side down and let them get golden brown over medium low heat. Turn them with a spatula without damaging the chicken and brown the other side. They will be cooking later so you just want to get the nice gold brown colour now. Heat the chicken stock. Remove the chicken from the pan, add the white wine and the cognac and deglaze the pan, scraping any pieces of meet stuck on the bottom. Let the alcohol evaporate completely, then add the mustard and dissolve in the sauce with a whisk. Add the chicken thighs to the pan, add the hot chicken stock to 2/3 of the hight of the chicken thighs. Season with salt and freshly ground white and black pepper and let simmer over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken thighs and keep warm.

Add the remaining cream and whisk. Now add a bit of hot sauce, whisk together very well and slowly pour in the pan, whisking well with all the sauce, over very low heat. Keep whisking so the sauce doesn't stick to the bottom. Let the sauce reduce again to the amount you need, always stirring. You will need about a cup of sauce to serve with the 8 chicken thighs. Pour the hot sauce over the chicken thighs and serve immediately with some potato mash."

"I have ginger, fresh red chiles, pork shoulder, sherry, garlic, olive oil.

Here's the instruction: The pork takes 24 hours to cook, which is no cause for alarm, because for about 23 hours and 55 minutes you are ignoring it absolutely. And it makes your house smell like a home should. So, if you're planning to eat this for Sunday lunch, at about Saturday lunchtime, preheat your (clean) oven to the hottest it will go. Sit the pork skin-side-up on a rack over a roasting pan. I like to use a mortar and pestle to make my paste but you could just grate the garlic and ginger (one of my beloved, and often mentions, a microplane grater is the tool for the job) and stir in chiles, a tablespoonful of oil and 2 of vinegar if you want. Otherwise, pound together the peeled chopped ginger and peeled cloves with the fresh chiles, adding a tablespoonful of oil and 2 of vinegar when they're squished and paste-like. Using your fingers, rub this paste over the scored skin, pushing bits into the cut lines of the rind. Stagger across to the oven and put in the tray, leaving it for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, into the bowl in which you mixed the paste, pour the 2 remaining tablespoons each of oil and vinegar. When the pork's had its half an hour, remove it from the oven, and turn the temperature down to 225 degrees F. Now turn the pork over: I find it easiest to lift it by hand wearing oven mitts. It makes them dirty, ok, but there is the washing machine. . . Pour the oil and vinegar over the underside (which is now uppermost on the rack) and put the pork back in the low oven, leaving it there for 23 hours. (Actually, you could leave it longer. One of the joys of this is that it cannot overcook.) Anyway, after 23 hours, or 30 to 40 minutes before you actually want to eat, turn the oven back to the highest it will go, remove the pork and turn it back crackling side up. Put it back in the oven for 30 minutes, in which time it will get hot and crisp, though you can give it another 10 if you feel it needs it. Remove, slice off the crackling in a horizontal swipe of the knife and break it into manageable pieces, then start carving or pulling at the tender meat."

Here's the instruction: Lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan with nonstick spray and place on a baking sheet. Make sure you have room in your freezer and fridge to place the tart pan later. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg yolk and mix to combine. Add the flour and salt and mix until the dough comes together and is uniform. The mixture should look like a stiff chocolate chip cookie dough - if it seems dry or crumbly, add a little milk (1 tablespoon at a time) until it comes together. Add the chocolate chunks and mix to combine. Press the dough into the prepared tart pan into an even layer - take special care to make sure the sides of the tart dough and the corner (where the sides meet the base) aren't too thick. Using a small measuring cup can help you get into those corners and ensure it's even. Place the tart pan into the freezer while you preheat the oven to 350°F. Press the tines of a fork all over the chilled dough to dock it. Bake until the crust is lightly golden brown and fully baked, 20 to 24 minutes. Cool completely. When the crust is cool, make the filling. Place the cool water in a small bowl, and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Heat 1 cup of the heavy cream, sugar, and the vanilla bean and scrapings in a medium pot, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the bloomed gelatin and heat until the mixture melts completely, about 1 minute. Place the hot liquid into a large vessel with a pour spout (such as a 4 cup liquid measuring cup), and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup cream and the milk, stirring well to combine. Remove the vanilla bean (if using vanilla extract instead of the bean, stir it in now). Pour the filling into the cooled crust, and gently transfer to the refrigerator. Chill until the filling is totally set, at least 1 hour, and up to 8 hours. The tart is now ready to serve, or you can add the optional topping. In an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip the cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla to medium peaks. Spread the cream on top of the tart, and decorate with mini chocolate chip cookies."

Divide the ball into about half. Round up the larger half (which will be the bottom crust). Shape it into a flat patty, pressing the sides flat until it's about an inch thick and looks like a big English muffin. Put the pastry patty on a floured board and prepare a rolling pin with a coating of flour. Roll out the patty, pinching the edges and adjusting your rolling pattern to keep it round and with an unbroken edge. It should be about 1/8 inch thick and over an inch larger than the 9-inch pie pan. Fold the dough over and set it in the pan, and then unfold it and let it settle in, patting and adjusting it to fit. Do not stretch it unduly as this will cause it to crack or shrink during baking. Set it aside and prepare the filling. Set the oven to 425 degrees with the rack in the lower third of the oven. Mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon and then mix this in with the berries. If they were frozen, proceed lightly so as to minimize crushing the juicy berries. Pour this mixture into the waiting bottom crust. If you have a pie bird, place him or her in the center and pour the berries around it. Dot the butter on the top of the berries. Roll out the ball for the top crust, using the patty method as before. You may slit small openings in the top before setting the crust over the berries. If you have a pie bird, you will want to make an opening for it. Seal and flute the edges. Cover the edges with aluminum foil, or use your handy pie crust shield to keep the edges from overcooking. Bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and you see the juice starting to bubble through the slits. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. Served warm, the juice may run. Served chilled, it will be thicker."

"I have chicken, salt. Give me some cooking ideas.","You can make Beginner Roast Chicken with 1 medium Chicken, 1 salt and pepper. Here's the instruction: Preheat the oven to about 375F. Place your chicken on a tray. Season it up. Let's stick to salt and pepper at first. There's nothing else you can add here that's going to make an improperly cooked chicken. There is no set amount. Just use dry fingers to sprinkle salt and fresh cracked pepper evenly over the surface of the beast. Place your chicken in the oven. Come back in about an hour. The skin should pretty much look like the picture, crispy and golden brown. If that's the case, pull the thing out and set it on the stove. Otherwise, let her ride another 10 minutes or so. Get your meat thermometer and check the internal temperature. Send the tip of the thermometer to the deepest point in the breast, but be careful not to rest it up against bone, as this can throw off your reading. Do the same at the deepest point of the thigh. The government says internal temperature should be 165F to be safe. I shoot for about 155F personally. Let it rest for 10 minutes before carving and the cooking will carry over. Do what you will. Carve this sucker up on the table like a mini Thanksgiving, or just tear it apart and use it for recipes throughout the week. If you're looking for some guidance on carving, just send me a message and I'll try to offer some tips. Collect all of the bones and the juices released from carving, and if available, also collect any juice or drippings from the pan (deglaze the cooking tray if you can), and place them in a pot or slow cooker, and cover with water. Add the giblets too if you were lucky enough to get any. Slow simmer for at least 12 hours, then strain. Throw away the bones and keep this luscious chicken nectar to use throughout the week. Make a soup or a sauce, or even just drink the stuff like tea if you like. This broth tastes great and provides a lot of nutrients that you don't much find in our modern diets. I really suggest doing this once a week. It's so helpful to have chicken and chicken stock on hand to help you weave through your culinary week. Make chicken salad one day, chicken enchiladas another day, or anything that suits you. Just type 'chicken' followed by whatever other ingredients you have on hand into the search bar (e.g., 'chicken carrots potatoes celery') and you'll get an idea of how useful this is. Once you've made 5 or 10 roast chickens, you might start to get good at it, and certainly put your own spin on the story. You'll be amazed what you can do with these few ingredients."

Here's the instruction: Heat the oven to 375F or 350F on convection. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment and set fourteen to fifteen 1 1/2-inch square molds on it. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, cloves, pepper, and salt together in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle. Add the butter and sugar and mix on medium speed until crumbly. Divide the streusel among the molds and press down so the streusel will hold a shape. Bake until crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and unmold the streusel. Let cool. Trim, peel, and chop the beets. Put through a juicer. Youll need the beet juice for the parfait and the beet-raspberry fluid gel. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment and set the 1 1/2-inch square molds on it. Freeze while you make the parfait. Put the 2 tablespoons heavy cream in a small bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin over the surface. Combine the beet juice, sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla seeds and pod in a heatproof bowl set over simmering water. Cook, whisking pretty constantly, until the mixture reaches 175F. Microwave the gelatin for 30 seconds or heat gently in a saucepan until melted. Strain the beet juice mixture into the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk. Add the gelatin and beat at medium-high speed until the sides of the bowl are cool. In a separate bowl, beat the 1/2 cup heavy cream to medium peaks. Fold the cream into the beet mixture. Fill a pastry bag with the parfait and pipe into the molds. Even off the tops. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze overnight. Puree the raspberries in a food processor. Strain and measure out 1/2 cup (125 g). Put the puree, beet juice, and agar in a saucepan and mix with an immersion blender. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour into a baking dish and refrigerate until set. Scrape the gel into a blender and blend on high until perfectly smooth and fluid. Store in the refrigerator until youre ready to serve or for up to 3 days. Run a 9 x 12-inch rimmed baking sheet under cold water and shake off the excess. Line the damp pan neatly with plastic wrap. Whisk the sugar and agar together in a small saucepan. Whisk in the milk. Stirring constantly, bring the milk to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, still stirring. Stir in the chocolate and emulsify with an immersion blender, keeping the blender under the surface so you avoid making bubbles. Pour into the baking sheet and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Use a spatula to smear some of the beet-raspberry fluid gel onto dessert plates. Set a streusel on each plate, on the gel. Unmold a parfait, pushing it out, and set it on top of the streusel. Cover the top of the parfait with cacao nibs. Cut the chocolate gel into 1/2 x 2-inch strips. Set one beside each parfait. Garnish with a few greens, the yogurt powder, and beet powder if you want. You could replace the chocolate brittle gel with chocolate ice cream. Scoop it, roll in Chocolate Crumble (page 213) or chocolate cookie crumbs, and refreeze. That way, youre bringing another layer of crunch to the plate. For larger portions, you could use a 3 1/4-inch tart ring and for tasting portions you could use 2-inch ring molds in place of the 1 1/2-inch square molds I use."

"I have vanilla, coconut flour, granulated sugar, heavy cream, full-fat, powdered sugar, coconut cream, flour, kosher salt, coconut oil, cardamom powder, lime, egg yolks. Give me some cooking ideas.","You can make Bebinca: Goan Layered Coconut Cake with 2 13.5-ounce cans of full-fat coconut milk (I like Chaokoh brand), 3 cups granulated sugar, 12 extra-large egg yolks, 1 cup coconut flour, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon cardamom powder, preferably freshly ground, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 lime, finely zested and juiced, 1 cup melted coconut oil, 1 cup coconut cream, chilled in the fridge overnight, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Here's the instruction: In a large, heatproof bowl, mix the coconut milk and sugar. Microwave for about 3 minutes, until the sugar is completely dissolved. In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, mix the egg yolks on medium speed for 2 minutes. With the motor running on low speed, slowly add the warm coconut milk and sugar mixture. Add the coconut flour, all-purpose flour, cardamom powder, salt, and lime zest and mix on low speed for a further couple of minutes, until no lumps remain. Check to make sure that the mixture has cooled enough and then add the lime juice and give it a good mix one last time. Pour it into a large bowl and chill in the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes. While the batter is chilling, prep your 9"" springform pan. Thoroughly grease the pan with coconut oil, put a circular piece of parchment paper in the bottom, and grease that too. Tear off a long piece of aluminum foil, fold it over so that it is about 4"" wide and wrap it around the base of the springform fan to prevent any leakage (just like you would when baking a cheesecake in a water bath). Place the prepared pan on a baking sheet. Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Turn the oven on to broil. Let it get good and hot for a couple of minutes. Take the batter out of the fridge. Put the baking sheet with the empty prepared springform pan in the oven for 30 seconds, to get it pretty hot. We want the bottom layer to start cooking right away; otherwise, it has a tendency to stick and fall apart. Take the baking sheet out of the oven, drizzle a bit of coconut oil on the parchment paper, and add one cup of the batter. Put it back in the middle of the oven and broil for 5 to 8 minutes. We want the top of the layer to get evenly browned, not just a freckle here and there! (see picture) If the top doesn't get evenly browned, you will not get the brown striations when you slice the cake (see picture). Once the top looks evenly browned, take it out of the oven, drizzle another 2 tablespoon of coconut oil evenly over the surface, stir the batter to get rid of any settling at the bottom, and add another cup of it. Then it goes back into the oven until it is browned all over. Repeat with the rest of the batter. Do not worry if the layers start to dome slightly; it'll flatten out when you add the oil and batter on top of it. This recipe will yield a seven layer cake. Do take note that when the broiler is on the ""off"" cycle, it'll take a while longer to brown on the top, but be patient and you'll be rewarded! Once all the seven layers have been baked off, let the cake cool in the pan on the counter for at least an hour. While the cake is cooling, make the coconut whipped cream. In the bowl of a stand mixer, with the whisk attachment, add the coconut cream, heavy cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Whisk on high speed for a couple of minutes until (very) soft peaks form. Put it back in the fridge so that it can firm up a bit. Chill the whipped coconut cream in the fridge until you are ready to serve. Once the cake is cooled (it'll pull slightly away from the sides), run a plastic knife around the edges, release it from the spring form pan, and serve immediately with the chilled coconut whipping cream. Enjoy!"

How to make Polpettone With Onion-Shallot Jam Over Creamy Root Vegetable Purée?,"You can make Polpettone With Onion-Shallot Jam Over Creamy Root Vegetable Purée with Onion-Shallot Jam and Creamy Root Vegetable Puree, Good olive oil to generously film pan, 2 yellow onions, peeled, fine dice, 4 shallots, peeled, fine dice, 4 ounces white wine, Sea or kosher salt to taste, 2 large parsnips, peeled, diced, 4 carrots, peeled, diced, 3"" piece fresh horseradish, peeled, diced, 1 quart Heavy cream, Sea or kosher salt and white pepper to taste, Polpettone and Filling, 1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes, rehydrated and drained, 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, 1/2"" dice, 3"" piece fresh horseradish, peeled, fine dice, Juice of 1 lemon (not Meyer - too sweet) &amp; zest of 1/2 of it, Sea or kosher salt and pepper to taste, 2 pounds ground turkey, 1/2 cup Panko, preferably fine, unseasoned, 1 large egg, 1 teaspoon sea or kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon dried oregano or 2 teaspoons fresh, chopped, 2 cups Panko, Green garnish of your choice. Here's the instruction: Prepare onion jam. Generously film bottom of a heavy-bottomed pan or skillet with some good olive oil over medium heat. When warm, add onions and shallots along with a couple of good pinches of salt. Cover pan, and when contents begin cooking nicely, reduce heat. Continue cooking, stirring often (if some bits brown, that's fine, just not too much). When it looks as if much of the water has been cooked away, stir in the white wine. Cook until a sweetly rich, silky concentration is reached. Remove from heat. You'll reheat just before serving. Alternatively, make twice as much. Store the extra in a container in your refrigerator. Add it to soups, salad dressings, omelettes, grilled cheese sandwiches, or anything you think could benefit from some sweet silken richness. While jam is reducing, begin cooking the root vegetables. Add cream to a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pot (aluminum will react badly with the lactic acid in the cream causing an off-taste and gray color). Add the vegetables, cover pot and begin heating over medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat a bit. Cook, stirring somewhat often, until vegetables can be VERY easily pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Remove from heat. You will reheat, puree, and season just before serving. It's much easier to reheat in the rough state. Prepare filling to set aside and permit flavors to blend. Place rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes, diced mozzarella, horseradish, lemon juice and zest in bowl of food processor. Pulse just until ingredients are relatively uniform in size - very small, but not a pureed paste. Scoop into a bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix polpettone. Place ground turkey, Panko, egg, salt & pepper, and oregano in a mixing bowl. If you've got gloves, use 'em. Mix ingredients with your hands until completely blended. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Shape and fill polpettone. Again wearing gloves, pick up a sort of small tennis-ball size of turkey mixture. Gently shape it into a ball. Press a large indentation into it with a thumb. With a spoon, scoop a generous amount of filling into it. Pinch it closed, then gently roll the polpettone between your palms to create a small football. Set on parchment. Repeat until all turkey mixture is gone. If you have filling left over, because not all of us visualize the same small-tennis-ball size, and ""generous"" can have different meanings, do not despair. Put it in a ziplock bag and freeze it. Use it in ravioli filling, in omelettes - you get my drift. Before baking, pour 2 cups Panko into a baking dish. Gently pick up each polpettone. Place in Panko, and with your hands gather it up around sides and end of polpettone. Turn it over and repeat on other side. Repeat until all polpettone have been coated. Bake polpettone until gently browned and and instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 165 degrees, about 20 minutes. While polpettone are baking, reheat root vegetables. When nicely hot, remove from heat and puree right in the pot with an immersion blender (if you don't have one, this would be an excellent reason to get one - and I don't take on new appliances quickly). Season to taste with salt and pepper. It should take your breath away, by the way. Also reheat the lovely onion-shallot jam. To serve, spread a puddle of the root vegetable puree in the center of each plate. Set two polpettone in it and top with the onion-shallot jam. Garnish with green of your choice - chopped fennel fronds, Italian parsley, basil chiffonade. Have a lovely dinner!"

How to make Cook The Book: Orecchiette With Fennel Sausage And Swiss Chard?,"You can make Cook The Book: Orecchiette With Fennel Sausage And Swiss Chard with 1 bunch Swiss chard, 1/4 cup extra- virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, 1/2 large yellow Spanish onion, thinly sliced, 12 garlic cloves, thinly sliced lengthwise, 2 dried arbol chiles, 3/4 pound Fennel Sausage (recipe follows), 1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, 1 cup chicken stock, or 1/4 cup salted pasta water mixed with 1/4 cup plain water, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, Kosher salt, 12 ounces Orecchiette, 3 tablespoons finishing-quality extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, 2 teaspoons fennel pollen, 2 tablespoons toasted bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons fennel seeds, 4 pounds boneless pork shoulder, 1 pound pork fatback, 3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic (about 10 large cloves), 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons hot paprika, 1 tablespoon fennel pollen, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 3/4 cup ice water. Here's the instruction: Toast the fennel seeds in a small skillet over high heat, shaking the skillet to keep the seeds from burning, until they are fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour the seeds onto a plate and set aside to cool to room temperature. Cut the pork shoulder and fatback into 1- inch cubes and put the cubes in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine the garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, paprika, fennel pollen, and toasted fennel seeds. Stir the seasonings together and sprinkle them over the pork and fatback. Toss to coat the meat with the seasonings, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to two days. (If you are in a hurry, you can put the meat in the freezer until it is ice cold, but not frozen.) Fit a meat grinder with the largest die and have the bowl of a standing mixer handy. Remove the meat from the refrigerator (or freezer) and pass it through the grinder, catching the gound meat into the mixer bowl. Fit the standing mixer with the paddle attachment. Combine the vinegar and ice water. Put the bowl with the ground meat in it on the standing mixer and mix them on low speed, gradually adding the vinegar and water until the meat is slightly sticky; you may not use all of the liquid. Use the sausage according to your recipe, or transfer it to an airtight container or several containers. Refrigerate the sausage for up to five days or in the freezer for up to three months. To prepare the chard, pull the leaves from the ribs. Roughly chop the leaves and set aside. Cut off and discard the very ends of the ribs and slice the ribs 1/4 inch thick. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium- high heat until it is almost smoking and slides easily in the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chard ribs, season with salt, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, until barely translucent. Add the onion, garlic, and chiles, and season with salt. Saute the vegetables for about 10 minutes, adding water to the pan (as much as 1 cup total), stirring often to prevent the vegetables browning. (You add water to the pan so you can saute and sweat the onion without browning it, but you never want the onion swimming in water-just enough so the pan isn't dry.) Add the chard leaves, season with salt, and fold the leaves in with the onion for 1 or 2 minutes to wilt them slightly. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the chard leaves are very dark green and the onion, leaves, and stems are one soft, homogenous mixture. Turn the vegetables out onto a cutting board and chop, cutting first in one direction and then perpendicular to the first direction, until the vegetables are finely chopped to the point of being almost pureed. Measure out a heaping 1/4 cup of the vegetables for the pasta dish. Use the rest as an excuse to prepare this dish again in the very near future, or spoon a heaping spoonful under a piece of grilled fish, topped with a spoonful of Salsa Verde. To make the sauce, heat a saute pan over high heat for about 2 minutes until it's very hot. Add the sausage to the pan and cook it undisturbed for about 2 minutes, until the meat is seared. Stir the meat and cook for another 4 minutes, breaking it into pea- size pieces, until it is cooked through. Add the chopped chard and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to warm it through, stirring the chard into the sausage as it cooks. Sprinkle the pepper over the chard and sausage, add the chicken stock, and cook the sauce for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to bring the ingredients together. Add the butter, stir until it melts, and turn off the heat while you cook the pasta. Fill a pasta pot or large stockpot with 6 quarts of water, add 6 tablespoons of salt, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. If you are not using a pasta pot, place a colander in the sink or have a large wire strainer handy to lift the pasta out of the pot. Remove the orecchiette from the refrigerator or the freezer and drop them into the boiling water. Stir to prevent the pasta from sticking together, partially cover the pot so the water returns to a boil quickly and continues boiling, and cook the pasta until it's al dente, about 2 minutes. About 1 minute before the pasta is done, place the sauce over high heat. Lift the pasta out of the cooking water or drain it and immediately add it to the pan with the sauce. Cook the pasta with the sauce together for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring with a rubber spatula, until the sauce is thick, adding fresh water to the pan if the pasta looks dry or sticky instead of slippery and glistening. Turn off the heat and add the finishing-quality olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and fennel pollen, stirring vigorously and shaking the pan to emulsify the sauce. Pile the orecchiette in the center of each of eight plates, dividing it evenly, and spoon any sauce left in the pan over the pasta. Sprinkle a generous tablespoon of bread crumbs over each serving, and serve with the remaining bread crumbs on the side."

How to make Tdiz Meat Hot Sauce?,"You can make Tdiz Meat Hot Sauce with 1 lb ground beef, 1 tablespoon flour, 1 tablespoon butter or 1 tablespoon beef fat, 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, 1/2 teaspoon clove, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons white vinegar or 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 3 tablespoons tomato paste. Here's the instruction: Brown the beef and drain. If you are using whole spices/herbs, which I prefer for this, add all to a mortar and pestle them into a fine powder. If you are using ground spices/herbs, just mix them all together in a bowl and set aside. Note that you'll need more than the measurements listed above if you're using whole spices like allspice and cloves. In the end you want the ground quantities to roughly match the amounts listed in the ingredient list. None of these measurements is super critical. After you make this, you'll likely tweak the spices to suit your taste anyway. In the beef browning pan, make a roux by cooking the flour with either 1 tablespoon of the beef fat or butter. I've done it both ways, couldn't tell the difference. Add the roux to a 4qt saucepan over medium low heat. Dump the beef/water mix in there. Add the spice mixture, vinegar, and tomato paste and whisk until it's all blended. Bring to a good simmer, stirring often. Then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for about an hour, stirring occasionally to keep the meat from settling to the bottom of the pan and burning. It will reduce and thicken and become delicious over that hour. Nothing wrong with two hours either! Finally, grind it up a bit right in the saucepan using a stick/immersion blender. You don't want to go too far with this and make a smooth milkshake, we're just trying to break down some of the big chunks so that the result is like finely ground beef that restaurants can get but we can't find so easily."

Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring once, until the rice is still slightly undercooked but the liquid is absorbed, 8 minutes. Pour the rice into a large bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Stir in 2 1/2 cups of the cheese and 3 of the eggs until well combined, and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a medium nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove the sausage from the casing and break into small, bite-size pieces. Add the sausage to the hot oil and cook until browned, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon as it cooks. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage to a medium bowl and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, shallots and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant and the shallots are soft, 1 minute. Add the basil, cheese rind and tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the basil and cheese rind. Add 2 cups of the sauce to the reserved sausage and set aside. Meanwhile, in a separate medium bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs, the milk and the remaining egg with a fork and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to thicken. Stir in the oregano, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Using your hands, mix in the beef, until just combined. Heat 1/2-inch of olive oil in a medium straight-sided pan. Scoop 1-tablespoon mounds of the mixture into damp hands and roll into uniform balls. When the oil is hot, fry the balls in 2 batches, turning them as needed with a slotted spoon to brown the balls evenly, about 4 minutes. When golden brown and crispy all around, remove the balls using a slotted spoon to the bowl with the sausage and sauce. Continue with the remaining balls, and then toss to coat evenly in the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using 1 tablespoon of the butter, grease the inside of a Bundt pan or a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven, making sure to coat it very well. Dust the inside of the pan with 3 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs. Make sure it is evenly coated and there are no bald spots. This is very important to prevent sticking. Add the peas and diced mozzarella to the meat and sauce, and toss gently to incorporate. Spoon two-thirds of the rice mixture into the prepared bundt pan. Using damp hands, press the rice evenly over the bottom of the pan and 2 1/2-inches up the sides and middle of the pan.

Place a plate large enough to cover the top of the pan over the pan. Using heat-resistant pads or a towel, invert the sartu onto the plate.

How to make Champagne Cake Roll With White Chocolate (White Chocolate Bûche De Noël) Recipe?,"You can make Champagne Cake Roll With White Chocolate (White Chocolate Bûche De Noël) Recipe with :, 5 large eggs, 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, 4 teaspoons sunflower oil, or canola oil, 2 1/2 tablespoons buttermilk, 1 tablespoon Marc de Champagne, or grappa, 5 1/2 ounces (about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) all-purpose flour, 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon table salt, 1/4 cup powdered sugar for sprinkling, :, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon Marc de Champagne or grappa, :, 3 large egg whites (about 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon), 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 1/3 sticks (about 11 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed and softened at room temperature, 2 teaspoons Marc de Champagne or grappa, :, 6 ounces of good quality white chocolate, 1/4 cup heavy cream, :, 5 ounces good quality white chocolate, Gold luster dust, optional, Sugar pearls, optional. Here's the instruction: Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a rimmed jelly roll pan with a little butter and line with baking parchment on bottom and sides. In a large bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer until tripled in volume and lightened in color, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running, add the sugar one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition. This should take about 2 minutes. Drizzle in the oil, buttermilk and Marc de Champagne and mix until incorporated. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture, one tablespoon at a time, mixing continuously until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan and carefully tilt pan to distribute batter in an even layer. Bake for until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean and top of the cake springs back when pressed with fingers, 12 to 15 minutes. While the cake is in the oven, place a clean, cotton tea towel (preferably one without decorative textures) on counter and sprinkle with powdered sugar, using your hands to rub the sugar into the tea towel. Once the cake is done, remove from oven and allow to cool for one minute, then immediately turn cake out onto the tea towel, carefully peel off the parchment and roll cake in the tea towel, starting at a short side. Roll slowly and tightly. Place cake roll (wrapped in tea towel) on a wire rack seam-side down until it has cooled completely. Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the syrup is clear. Remove from heat, transfer to a mug and allow to cool. Once cool, combine 1/4 cup of syrup with the Marc de Champagne. (Remaining syrup can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for another use.) In a medium-sized heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg whites and sugar. Place the bowl over a small pan with simmering water, making sure the water doesn't touch the bowl. Keep whisking the mixture until sugar has dissolved. You can easily check whether the sugar has dissolved by rubbing a bit of the mixture between your fingers; the mixture shouldn't feel grainy. If you're not worried about salmonella, you can take the mixture off the heat at this point. If you want to pasteurize the meringue, keep whisking until the mixture reaches a temperature of 71°C/160°F using a candy thermometer. Once the meringue reaches the desired temperature, take it off the heat. Using a hand held or a stand mixer, beat the warm mixture until the meringue holds stiff peaks and the bottom of the bowl feels cool to the touch. Add butter one cube at a time, beating well with the electric mixer after each addition. The mixture may start to look as if it's separating during this process but don't panic: just keep beating and the buttercream will come together and become smooth. Once the buttercream is smooth and creamy, add Marc de Champagne and again mix until smooth. Once the cake has cooled to room temperature, carefully unroll the cake roll and place it on a clean work surface. Allow the tightest rolled end to curl back in to prevent the cake from cracking. Should it crack a little, that's fine; you won't see it after you roll it back up. Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of the cake roll with the champagne syrup. Frost with the Champagne buttercream, leaving a one-inch border uncovered at the uncurled end. Reroll cake starting from the curled end. Combine cream and white chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate has melted and the ganache is smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to body temperature. Once cool, beat ganache with a mixer until it lightens in color. It should be thick, but easily spreadable. Frost the cake roll with the white chocolate ganache, using the back of a spoon to create a bark-like pattern. Allow excess ganache to drip down onto the cookie sheet. Place cake (wire rack and all) in the fridge until ganache has set. place a cookie sheet in the freezer. Carefully melt the chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler, stirring occasionally. Once the chocolate has melted, remove the cookie sheet from the freezer and line it with baking parchment. Pour the melted white chocolate onto the sheet. Using the back of a spoon, spread the chocolate in an even layer. Allow chocolate to set completely in the refrigerator. Once set, use a sharp knife to cut the chocolate into shards. Using a clean, dry paintbrush, brush the chocolate shards with the gold luster dust. Once the ganache has set, remove the cake from the fridge. Heat a serrated knife by placing the knife in a tall container filled with hot water. Dry the knife and trim 1/2 inch off both ends of the cake, wiping the knife clean between cuts. Run a sharp knife along the perimeter of the cake to loosen the ganache from the wire rack. Carefully transfer the cake to a serving plate or cake stand using a large spatula. Decorate with the chocolate shards and sugar pearls as desired. Allow the cake to come to room temperate before serving. This should take 2-3 hours. Undecorated cake (finished cake roll without the chocolate shards and sugar pearls) can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. Decorate just before serving."

Rub the cavity with a little salt. Cut off the two ends of the oranges, stand them on end and carefully slice off the skin (once you have removed one piece of skin you can see where the flesh meets the skin). Slice the oranges into five or six rounds each. Remove the tougher outside ribs of the celery until you reach the white, dense bulb and slice across thinly. Put in a bowl, mix in the thyme and a small pinch of salt and pepper, then stuff the cavity of each guinea fowl with this filling. Pull the skin at the front of each guinea fowl's cavity forward, to cover the filling, and tightly tie/truss up. Heat a thick-bottomed pan and add the olive oil and the guinea fowl, the skin of which has been rubbed in sea salt and pepper. Cook until lightly golden on all sides, then add the garlic, butter and sage and cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Add the wine at intervals, enough to keep the pan slightly moist at all times. Place in the oven for 45 minutes, checking every 10-15 minutes and just topping up the wine as necessary. The guinea fowl will be roasted and partially steamed. When cooked, carefully remove from the oven and place upside down on a dish, allowing all the juices and moisture to relax back into the breast meat for at least 5 minutes. While your meat is resting, make the gravy. Remove all the fat from the roasting pan and place the pan on gentle heat. In the bottom of the pan will be your cooked, soft, sweet, whole garlic cloves and some gorgeous sticky stuff--when this gets hot, scoop out the stuffing from the guinea fowl cavity and add to the pan with about 2/3 cup of wine. As the wine boils and steams, scrape all the goodness with a spoon from the bottom of the pan into the liquor. When it has all dissolved, leave to simmer gently. Squash the cooked garlic out of their skins with a spoon (discard the skins); this will also thicken the gravy slightly, as well as give it flavor. Pour any of the juices that have drained out of the rested birds into the pan with the gravy, simmer and season to taste. Serve the guinea fowl with roast potatoes and any simply cooked green vegetable--spinach, kale, bok choy or broccoli."

Here's the instruction: Do not attempt to make meringue pies on a humid day.  Make sure the bottom crust is baked and cool before adding custard and meringue.  For custard: Heat raw raspberries slowly over medium heat, crushing and smashing to release the juice. Simmer, but do not allow to boil. When most of the juice is released, use a mesh strainer to separate hot juice from the seeds and pulp. Add freshly squeezed juice from 1 lemon; set aside. [Note: you can save the pulp for making preserves]  Sift together sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt. Place in a medium saucepan and slowly add milk, water, and the grape juice. Whisk constantly while bringing to a gentle simmer.  Transfer about half of this hot liquid, 1/4 cup at a time, to the container holding the beaten egg yolks. Whisk quickly to avoid ""making an omelet"". Once the yolks are well-mixed into about half of the hot liquid, re-combine back into the saucepan on the stovetop. Simmer gently for about 5 minutes, whisking thoroughly.  Remove from heat and immediately add the raspberry/lemon juice mixture and the lemon zest. Whisk well and set aside, covered.  For meringue: (If you decide to reduce the sugar in this recipe, it is recommended to reduce it from the custard portion, not the meringue portion.)  Beat egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add sugar gradually while still beating until meringue thickens. Continue beating until it will hold stiff peaks.  Pour warm raspberry custard into the crust, and after it's cooled a bit more, gently spoon the meringue over the top.
