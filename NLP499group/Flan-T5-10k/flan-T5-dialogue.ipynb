Ned is the head of an ancient and powerful house in the north of the Seven Kingdoms, but he is nothing like the scheming lords of the south. He is a man of incredible honor and integrity, a loyal friend and the driving force behind his family. Despite facing tremendous odds, Ned remains steadfast and determined in his duty to do what is right, even if it means great personal cost. In many ways, Ned serves as a moral compass for the show, and his sense of duty and justice serves as a contrast to the political machinations of the south.\",\n          \"Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nDescribe the effects of exponential growth.\\n\\n### Response:\\nExponential growth is a phenomenon in which an amount increases at an increasing rate over time. It is usually represented by a graph where the amount doubles over time. The effect of exponential growth can be seen in various aspects of the world. For instance, populations of certain species can exponentially increase with favorable conditions, while the spread of diseases can exponentially increase when left unchecked. Technology can also undergo exponential growth if there is strong demand and a rapid rate of innovation. Ultimately, exponential growth can help bring about tangible change when managed in a controlled manner, or create serious problems when left unchecked.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":154}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"j2VcQ8dKzZTg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556966728,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}},"outputId":"1ba2c8e1-318d-49f7-d3b6-7e16ebde399b"},"execution_count":155,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(52002, 4)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":155}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset.dtypes"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cAV710au7O7_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556967823,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":180,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}},"outputId":"a1c417cb-427c-44ce-9572-ba33a20f4cdd"},"execution_count":156,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["instruction    object\n","input          object\n","output         object\n","text           object\n","dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":156}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset['input'].fillna('', inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"4b9SQ7xn2jqq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556969297,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}}},"execution_count":157,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset['output'] = dataset['output'].astype(str)\n","dataset['instruction'] = dataset['instruction'].astype(str)\n","dataset['input'] = dataset['input'].astype(str)"],"metadata":{"id":"qjo3w-Sd9C6J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556970209,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":164,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}}},"execution_count":158,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset['prompt'] = dataset['instruction'] + dataset[\"input\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"tIzQW3eM05Va","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556979651,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":176,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}}},"execution_count":159,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset['prompt'] = dataset['prompt'].apply(lambda x: x.replace('\\n', '').strip())"],"metadata":{"id":"kygNaqyo5bo5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556980728,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":295,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}}},"execution_count":160,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset['output'] = dataset['output'].apply(lambda x: x.replace('\\n', '').strip())"],"metadata":{"id":"aE89yVNo5nQe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556981565,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":179,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}}},"execution_count":161,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":891},"id":"Zp9pBUZB093n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556982960,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":532,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}},"outputId":"bb70f16b-859a-4ba5-f768-9ea6aaf2ae65"},"execution_count":162,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                         instruction input  \\\n","0               Give three tips for staying healthy.         \n","1                 What are the three primary colors?         \n","2                 Describe the structure of an atom.         \n","3                   How can we reduce air pollution?         \n","4  Describe a time when you had to make a difficu...         \n","\n","                                              output  \\\n","0  1.Eat a balanced diet and make sure to include...   \n","1  The three primary colors are red, blue, and ye...   \n","2  An atom is made up of a nucleus, which contain...   \n","3  There are a number of ways to reduce air pollu...   \n","4  I had to make a difficult decision when I was ...   \n","\n","                                                text  \\\n","0  Below is an instruction that describes a task....   \n","1  Below is an instruction that describes a task....   \n","2  Below is an instruction that describes a task....   \n","3  Below is an instruction that describes a task....   \n","4  Below is an instruction that describes a task....   \n","\n","                                              prompt  \n","0               Give three tips for staying healthy.  \n","1                 What are the three primary colors?  \n","2                 Describe the structure of an atom.  \n","3                   How can we reduce air pollution?  \n","4  Describe a time when you had to make a difficu...

He is a man of incredible honor and integrity, a loyal friend and the driving force behind his family. Despite facing tremendous odds, Ned remains steadfast and determined in his duty to do what is right, even if it means great personal cost.

It is usually represented by a graph where the amount doubles over time. The effect of exponential growth can be seen in various aspects of the world. For instance, populations of certain species can exponentially increase with favorable conditions, while the spread of diseases can exponentially increase when left unchecked. Technology can also undergo exponential growth if there is strong demand and a rapid rate of innovation. Ultimately, exponential growth can help bring about tangible change when managed in a controlled manner, or create serious problems when left unchecked.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 52002,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Describe the character of the protagonist in the given TV show.Game of Thrones\",\n          \"Construct a poem that describes the beauty of a sunset.\",\n          \"Describe the effects of exponential growth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":162}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from datasets import Dataset\n","dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(dataset)"],"metadata":{"id":"oDVNOLFK4Fk-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556989107,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":197,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}}},"execution_count":163,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9DgWw3Wo5Lin","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713556994692,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":156,"user":{"displayName":"Yitian Yan","userId":"14985689977831623292"}},"outputId":"d347aa0b-c1c5-49b3-c555-2e941588a834"},"execution_count":165,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'instruction': 'Give three tips for staying healthy.',\n"," 'input': '',\n"," 'output': '1.Eat a balanced diet and make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables. 2.
