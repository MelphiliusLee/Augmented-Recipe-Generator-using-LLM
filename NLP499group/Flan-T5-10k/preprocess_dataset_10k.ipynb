Here's the instruction: Soak raisins in orange juice until they plump up, about 1 to 2 hours; strain, and set aside Toss fennel wedges in one tablespoon of olive oil, pepper and salt; spread on a lined baking sheet and roast in a 350\\u00b0 F oven for about 12 to 15 minutes, until edges are beginning to brown, and the fennel wedges are softening, but still have a little bite. Toast almonds on a separate pan in the oven until lightly browned. Allow to cool. Coarsely chop and set aside. While fennel and almonds are in the oven, bring chicken stock to a boil over high heat. Add couscous, stir, cover, and remove from heat. Let rest for about 15 minutes until all of the stock is absorbed. In a separate bowl, whisk together shallots and vinegar, then whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add pepper and salt to taste. Transfer couscous to a serving bowl and fluff with fork. Stir in the orange-soaked raisins and fennel fronds. Toss with enough of the vinaigrette to lightly coat everything-and be sure to include all of the shallot bits.
